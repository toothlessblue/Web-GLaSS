The cool bit TM

```cpp
// Generates a really hard-to-read matrix, but a normal, standard 4x4 matrix nonetheless 
glm::mat4 projectionMatrix = glm::perspective( 
	glm::radians(FoV), // The vertical Field of View, in radians: the amount of "zoom". Think "camera lens". Usually between 90° (extra wide) and 30° (quite zoomed in) 
	4.0f / 3.0f, // Aspect Ratio. Depends on the size of your window. Notice that 4/3 == 800/600 == 1280/960, sounds familiar ?
	0.1f, // Near clipping plane. Keep as big as possible, or you'll get precision issues. 
	100.0f // Far clipping plane. Keep as little as possible.
);
```
This matrix gives the camera perspective
